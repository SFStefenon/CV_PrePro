# Preprocessing using Computer Vision Technics

The dataset presents a preprocessing of the output of the YOLOv5 model for the detection of insulators.

There are 12,827 original images (cropping) used for training and validation, which can be also used for testing.


The files are organized as follows:
Training: 10,886

Validation: 1,941

The preprocessing used 5 technics are:

* **Gaussian Blur**

* **Binarization with threshold**

* **Adaptive threshold**

* **Threshold with Otsu and Riddler-Calvard**

* **Canny edge detection**

* **Sobel edge detection**


After the aplication of these preprocessing tecchnics, this dataset has ***89,789 files*** (including the original files).

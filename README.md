# CV_PrePro
 
The dataset presents a preprocessing of the output of YOLOv5 model for detection of insulators.

There are xx original images (cropping) used for training and validation, which can be also used for testing.


The preprocessing used 5 technics are:

* **Gaussian Blur**

* **Binarization with threshold**

* **Adaptive threshold**

* **Threshold with Otsu and Riddler-Calvard**

* **Canny edge detection**

* **Sobel edge detection**

# CV_PrePro
 
The dataset presents a preprocessing of the output of YOLOv5 for insulator detection.

There are xx original images (cropping) used for training and validation, which can be also used for testing.

The preprocessing used 5 technics 

## Gaussian Blur
## Binarization with threshold
## Adaptive threshold
## Threshold with Otsu and Riddler-Calvard
## Canny edge detection 
## Sobel edge detection

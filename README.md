# Preprocessing using Computer Vision Technics

The dataset presents a preprocessing of the output of the YOLOv5 model for the detection of insulators.

There are 12,827 original images used for training and validation (Training: 10,886 and Validation: 1,941), which can be also used for testing.
 
The 5 preprocessing technics are used:

* **Gaussian blur**

* **Binarization with threshold**

* **Adaptive threshold**

* **Threshold with Otsu and Riddler-Calvard**

* **Canny edge detection**

* **Sobel edge detection**

After the application of these preprocessing technics, this dataset has ***89,789 files*** (including the original files).

An example of the output compared to the original image is presented here:
